<h1> Old Cloth Upcycle </h1>

<h4>
  Project Intro:
</h4>

<h5>


In this project, I created a new garment that was upcycled and improved <br/>from old clothes. I spent a whole day in Brooklyn, looking for some vintage pie-<br/>ces that may inspire me. Coincidently, I burst into a military store, and picked a <br/>bag, a military jacket, because when I looked at those old pieces, I was thinki-<br/>ng about my grandfather and the military stories that he told me when I was <br/>very young. Miltary style is always a solemn topic for me, since I feel there is<br/> a really strong connection between me and my grandfather. So, with no hesitat-<br/>ion, I was going to that direction.
