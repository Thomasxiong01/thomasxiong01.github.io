      I went to the river
			once there, I wandered in
	I went to the river
	and washed away my sin
			i came back from the river
				I found my truck up on the road
	i came back from the river
		ready to re-load

					I'm not sure if this is how to say it
					drinking with the devil takes it's toll
					you have to walk away instead of staying
					for if you stay the devil gets your soul

									you can live a life of excess if you want to
									an endless circle pushed to the extremes
									the party seems like it is never ending
									but when it does, you're left with broken dreams

			you can reload if you want but just be cautious
			the devil knows your weakness after all
			he knows you wash your sins out in the river
			but, he also knows, one day you'll hear his call

							I went to the river
							once there, I wandered in
							I went to the river
							and washed away my sin
							i came back from the river
							I found my truck up on the road
							i came back from the river

			you have a choice when you go to the river
			do you follow it, and just avoid the road
			get on a boat and see where it is leading
			or just have a splash, and meet at the cross road

						life is full of twists and turns and effort
						the river is just a stop along the way
							but, the devil knows you never really mean it
							once you wash your sins, you head on back to play

			in the end you'll end up on the roadway
			the river bed is dry and is long dead
			the sins you washed away there are just dust now
			because there was no truth in what you said
