        the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is
        the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is all alone
        when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in
        decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely
        completely uninteresting. It is evident that is you ask a question you
        ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is
        a question as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore
        wherefore should one use the question mark. Beside it does not in its
        form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the
        ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of
        something. A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is
        a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already
        there when the question is already there in the writing.
