          What does a comma do. I have refused them so often and left the out so
          much and did without them so continually that I have come finally to
          be indifferent to them. I do not now care whether you put them in or
          not but for a long time I felt very definitely about them and would
          have nothing to do with them.

          <br />As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own,
          and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing oneâ€™s own
          interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own
          interest in what I am doing. A comma by helping you along holding your
          coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life
          as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still
          do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to
          them, the use of them was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I
          feel and what I mean and what I felt and what I meant.

          <br />When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of
          Americans, verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial
          clauses became a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize
          verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns
          as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.

          <br />Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I
          have always liked dependent adverbial clauses. I have like dependent
          adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and
          independence. You can see how loving the intensity of complication of
          these things that commas would be degrading. Why if you want the
          pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive
          complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that
          simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. Do you
          see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I do.
