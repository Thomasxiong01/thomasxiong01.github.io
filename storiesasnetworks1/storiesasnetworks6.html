        There are two different way of thinking about
        <span class="green">colons</span> and
        <span class="green">semicolons</span> you can think of them as
        <span class="green">commas</span>
        and as such they are purely <span class="green">servile</span> or you
        can think of them as periods and then using them can make you feel
        adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I
        myself never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and
        commas are <span class="green">servile</span> they have no life of their
        own they are dependent upon use and
        <span class="green">convenience</span> and they are put there just for
        practical purposes. <span class="green">Semi-colons</span> and
        <span class="green">colons</span>
        had for me from the first completely this character the character that a
        comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and
        definitely I have <span class="green">never used</span> them. But now
        dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might
        have in them something of the character of the period and so it might
        have been an <span class="green">adventure</span> to use them. I really
        do not think so. I think however lively they are or disguised they are
        they are definitely more comma than period and so really I
        <span class="green"> cannot regret </span>
        not having used them. They are more powerful more imposing more
        pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same. They really
        have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the comma
        nature. And now what does a comma do and what has it to do and why do I
        feel as I do about them.
