        One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that
        is the <span class="apostrophe"> apostrophe </span>for possession. Well feel as you like about that, I
        can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case
        apostrophe has a <span class="apostrophe"> gentle </span> tender insinuation that makes it very difficult
        to definitely decide to do without it. One does do without it, I do, I
        mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself
        having <span class="apostrophe">regrets </span> and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive
        case. I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret,
        there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s
        well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness.
        At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone
        if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. I cannot positively deny
        but that I do from time to time let it come in.
